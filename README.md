# KrakenEnvKeeper - Securely Manage Environment Variables in PHP Projects

KrakenEnvKeeper is a Composer package that helps you securely load and access environment variables from a
dedicated `.env` file within your PHP applications. It provides a convenient and reliable way to manage sensitive data.

## Features

- Loads environment variables securely from a designated `.env` file.
- Catches missing variables and throws exceptions for better error handling.
- Optimizes performance by caching loaded variables.
- Monitors the `.env` file for changes, automatically reloading variables when necessary.

## Additional Notes

**Security Considerations:**

* ****Never**** store your ```.env``` file in version control systems like Git.
* Consider using environment variable encryption to further enhance security, especially in production environments.
  Encryption adds an extra layer of protection for your sensitive data.

**Error Handling:**

* The ```get``` method throws an exception for missing variables. If a missing variable might be expected in some cases,
  provide a custom default value to avoid these exceptions. This can improve code flow and readability.

**Customizable File Path:**

* The constructor allows for customization of the ```.env``` file location. By default, it looks for a file
  named ```.env``` in the root directory of the project. You can adjust this to fit your project structure.

**Cache Optimization:**

* The cache helps improve performance by preventing unnecessary file reloads. For complex setups, you might consider
  alternative caching mechanisms for optimized performance.

## ⚠️ **Development Mode Notice**:

Please note that this is the development version of KrakenEnvKeeper. Functionality and APIs might be subject to change.
Consider using a stable release for production environments.

## Installation

**1. Require the package using Composer:**

```bash
composer require devkraken/kraken-env-keeper
```

**2. (Optional) Customize the .env file path:**

By default, KrakenEnvKeeper looks for a file named .env in the root directory of your project. If you prefer a different
location, update the constructor call in your code:

```php
$envKeeper = new DevKraken\KrakenEnvKeeper('/path/to/your/.env');
```

## Usage

**1. Load environment variables:**

```php
$envKeeper = new DevKraken\KrakenEnvKeeper();
$envKeeper->load();
```

**2. Access environment variables:**

- Use the get method to retrieve a specific variable:

```php
$apiKey = $envKeeper->get('API_KEY');
```

- Use the has method to check if a variable exists:

```php
if ($envKeeper->has('DEBUG_MODE')) {
    // Enable debugging if set
}
```
