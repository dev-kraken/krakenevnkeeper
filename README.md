# ü¶ë KrakenEnvKeeper - Securely Manage Environment Variables in PHP Projects

KrakenEnvKeeper is a Composer package that helps you securely load and access environment variables from a dedicated `.env` file within your PHP applications. It provides a convenient and reliable way to manage sensitive data.

## ‚ú® Features

- üîí Loads environment variables securely from a designated `.env` file.
- üö® Catches missing variables and throws exceptions for better error handling.
- üöÄ Optimizes performance by caching loaded variables.
- üëÄ Monitors the `.env` file for changes, automatically reloading variables when necessary.

## üìù Additional Notes

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Never** store your `.env` file in version control systems like Git.
- üîê Consider using environment variable encryption to further enhance security, especially in production environments. Encryption adds an extra layer of protection for your sensitive data.

### ‚ö° Error Handling

- The `get` method throws an exception for missing variables. If a missing variable might be expected in some cases, provide a custom default value to avoid these exceptions. This can improve code flow and readability.

### üóÇÔ∏è Customizable File Path

- The constructor allows for customization of the `.env` file location. By default, it looks for a file named `.env` in the root directory of the project. You can adjust this to fit your project structure.

### üíæ Cache Optimization

- The cache helps improve performance by preventing unnecessary file reloads. For complex setups, you might consider alternative caching mechanisms for optimized performance.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Development Mode Notice

Please note that this is the development version of KrakenEnvKeeper. Functionality and APIs might be subject to change. Consider using a stable release for production environments.

## üöÄ Installation

1. Require the package using Composer:

    ```bash
    composer require devkraken/kraken-env-keeper
    ```

2. (Optional) Customize the .env file path:

By default, KrakenEnvKeeper looks for a file named .env in the root directory of your project. If you prefer a different location, update the constructor call in your code:

## üîß Usage

1. Load environment variables:
    
    ```php
    $envKeeper = new DevKraken\KrakenEnvKeeper();
    $envKeeper->load();
    ```
2. Access environment variables:
* Use the `get` method to retrieve a specific variable:

    ```php
    $apiKey = $envKeeper->get('API_KEY');
    ```
* Use the has method to check if a variable exists:
    ```php
    if ($envKeeper->has('DEBUG_MODE')) {
        // Enable debugging if set
    }
    ```
